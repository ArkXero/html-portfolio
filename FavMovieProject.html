    a perfect movie that has infinite rewatchability. Even though I didn't fully
    understand the story behind the action at the time, I still loved it and
    enjoyed the action packed sequences of motor chases and gunfights. Once I
    grew older and began to understand the actual story, my love for the movie
    only grew. I began to reshape my entire view on this film and it genuinely
    made it so much better.
